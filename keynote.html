  <p class="body">Professor Patrick Fairclough completed his undergraduate and postgraduate studies at the University of Birmingham, graduating with a PhD in Neutron Scattering in 1995. He spent a short period in industry developing bespoke scientific equipment before returning to academia, focusing on scattering techniques applied to Polymers and Soft Condensed Matter. He took an academic position, in Chemistry, at the University of Sheffield in 1997, and moved to a chair in manufacturing within Mechanical Engineering in 2013.</p>

  <p class="body">Prof. Fairclough research covers a range of polymers, common in the coatings and composites industries. His team has interests in the manufacturing of coatings and composites ranging from synthetic polymer chemistry, phase separation, networks and diffusion, to novel manufacturing technologies. He works with a wide variety of scientist and engineers from academic, industry and health care. </p>

  <p class="keynote-topic"><b>Topic of Keynote:</b>Natural Material Short Fibre Composites via Additive Manufacturing</p>
