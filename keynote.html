  <p class="body">Professor Patrick Fairclough completed his undergraduate and postgraduate studies at the University of Birmingham, graduating with a PhD in Neutron Scattering in 1995. He spent a short period in industry developing bespoke scientific equipment before returning to academia, focusing on scattering techniques applied to Polymers and Soft Condensed Matter. He took an academic position, in Chemistry, at the University of Sheffield in 1997, and moved to a chair in manufacturing within Mechanical Engineering in 2013.</p>

  <p class="body">Prof. Fairclough research covers a range of polymers, common in the coatings and composites industries. His team has interests in the manufacturing of coatings and composites ranging from synthetic polymer chemistry, phase separation, networks and diffusion, to novel manufacturing technologies. He works with a wide variety of scientist and engineers from academic, industry and health care. </p>

  <p class="keynote-topic"><b>Topic of Keynote:</b> Natural Material Short Fibre Composites via Additive Manufacturing</p>

  <p class="body">Peter D. Folkow is Associate Professor at Department of Mechanics and Maritime Sciences at Chalmers University of Technology in Gothenburg. He received his PhD degree in Mechanics studying inverse wave propagation problems in beams and plates. His research interest has developed towards studying various direct wave propagation and structural dynamics problems; both of applied nature, e.g. energy harvesting, and of more basic oriented nature. Among the latter, he has for 20 years participated in the development of more accurate theories for structural elements (beams, plates, shells) applicable to all sorts of materials such as sandwich, anisotropic, poroelastic, functionally graded, piezoelectric and micromechanic materials.</p>

  <p class="body">Dr Folkow is since 2015 head of the Division of Dynamics at Chalmers. The divisionâ€™s research covers several fields within solid dynamics such as modal analyses, multibody dynamics, wave propagation and fatigue phenomena. In addition the division is host for the National Centre of Excellence in Railway Mechanics (CHARMEC). </p>

  <p class="keynote-topic"><b>Topic of Keynote:</b>A Systematic Approach to Develop a Family of Theories for Structural Elements</p>
