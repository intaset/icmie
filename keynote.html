  <p class="body">Michal K. Budzik received PhD degrees in Mechanical Engineering from Laboratory for Mechanics and Physics, University of Bordeaux (France) and in Materials Engineering from Materials Science Division, Gdansk University of Technology (Poland) - both awarded in 2010. He was a post-doctoral fellow at The National Centre for Science and Research (CNRS, France), The National Centre for Space Studies (CNES, France), and within a joint Danish Technical University Ris√∏ (DTU)/Aarhus University (AU) Innovation Fund (IFD) project in Denmark. At the present he holds an Associate Professor position at the Department of Engineering (ENG), Mechanical Engineering section (ME) of Aarhus University. His research focuses on interfacial mechanics and adhesion where, both, fundamental and applied mechanics problems are addressed. </p>

  <p class="keynote-topic"><b>Topic of Keynote:</b> Length scales of interfacial fracture toughness </p>
